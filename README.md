# to-do-app

Made with Vanilla Javascript, this project is a to-do-list capable of adding and removing tasks as well as subdividing them into projects. 
Earlier, the project had something resembling a backend with the help of the Local Storage API, which was later replaced with the Session Storage API, following issues with Github Hosting. The user's data will be stored even after reloads and session interruptions.
